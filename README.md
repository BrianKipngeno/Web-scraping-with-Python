We begin by exploring key metrics such as opening, closing, high, and low prices, along with trading volumes. This helps in identifying trends, volatility, and significant events in the stock's behavior. The dataset also allows for time series analysis, revealing long-term trends and seasonal patterns in Netflix’s stock price movements.

Through correlation analysis, we examine relationships between various price points and trading volumes, helping to understand dependencies and fluctuations. Visualizations highlight key insights, such as stock price highs and lows, as well as periods of intense trading activity.

To predict future stock prices, we implement a linear regression model, which leverages historical data to forecast short-term stock movements. This predictive modeling approach provides a practical tool for investors and stakeholders to anticipate future trends.

Overall, the project offers a comprehensive analysis of Netflix’s stock performance, combining data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization to generate actionable insights.
